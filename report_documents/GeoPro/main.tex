\section{Methodologies}
\subsection{Vector heat method}
The vector heat method is presented in algorithm \ref{algo1}: the vector heat equation is used to diffuse the input vector field and then the scalar heat vector is used to adjust the magnitude of the resulting vectors. Indeed, the vector heat equation gives vectors pointing to the right directions for small values of time $t$ but the magnitudes are wrong. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Vector Heat Method} \label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Require A vector field $X$ supported on a subset $\Omega \subset M$ of the domain $M$.
\Ensure A vector field $\overline{X}$ on all of $M$.
%\Input{A vector field $X$ supported on a subset $\Omega \subset M$ of the domain $M$.}
%\Output{A vector field $\overline{X}$ on all of $M$.}

\noindent \textbf{I.} Integrate the vector heat flow $\frac{d}{dt} Y_t = \Delta Y_t$ for time $t$, with $Y_0 = X$. \\

\textbf{II.} Integrate the scalar heat flow $\frac{d}{dt} u_t = \Delta u_t$ for time $t$, with $u_0 = |X|$. \\

\textbf{III.} Integrate the scalar heat flow $\frac{d}{dt} \phi_t = \Delta \phi_t$ for time $t$, with $\phi_0 = \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}$. \\

\textbf{IV.} Evaluate the vector field $\overline{X}_t = \frac{u_t Y_t}{\phi_t |Y_t|}$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Step 1: get the right directions}
As mentioned earlier, the idea of the vector heat method is to use the vector heat equation 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vector-heat}
  \frac{d}{dt} X_t = \Delta^\nabla X_t
  \end{equation}
to diffuse the initial vector field. The symbol $\Delta^\nabla$ denotes the connection Laplacian associated to the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$. 
We now consider a fundamental solution to the heat equation: the \textbf{heat kernel} denoted by $k_t^\nabla$. $k_t^\nabla(x,y)$ describes how 
a vector at a single point $x$ will diffuse to all other points $y$ over time $t$. For $y$ not on the cut locus of $x$, the following asymptotic
expansion holds:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:asymptotic_expansion}
  k_t^\nabla(x, y) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{d(x, y)^2}{4t}}}{(4 \pi t)^{n/2} j(x, y)^\frac{1}{2}} 
\left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} t^i \Psi_i(x, y) \right)
  \end{equation}
\subsubsection{Step 2: get the right magnitudes}
\begin{comment}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{An algorithm with caption}\label{alg:cap}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Require $n \geq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$
\State $y \gets 1$
\State $X \gets x$
\State $N \gets n$
\While{$N \neq 0$}
\If{$N$ is even}
    \State $X \gets X \times X$
    \State $N \gets \frac{N}{2}$  \Comment{This is a comment}
\ElsIf{$N$ is odd}
    \State $y \gets y \times X$
    \State $N \gets N - 1$
\EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\end{comment}

\section{Experiences}
\subsection{Introduction}

\subsection{Our set-up}
(icel)
To realise these experiences, we first tested the C++ demo presented in the paper's website. The solvers for the scalar and vector heat methods were implemented in a library named Geometry Central. These methods were also implemented by the author of the paper in a python library named Potpourri3d. We worked with the latter, using Trimesh for the manipulation of meshes and PyVision to visualize the results.

For the 3d bodies used throught the experiment, we started with those in the XXX github repository, as they presented clean 3d manifolds.

To clean some meshes we implemented a function ...

\subsection{Scalar heat rebustess (different noise types)}
(icel)
To test noise rebustness on the scalar heat method, we first recreated the same type of perturbations as in the paper. For this we added a gaussian noise to each point in the 3 directions [fig X]. After this, we computed the distances from a single point and analyzed the results.

We noted that these perturbations seem to be very artificial, so we implemented another noise adding mechanism where we switched the vertices of some triangle meshes depending on their proximity or randomly removed some triangles [fig Y]. Reaplying the same solver, we see that the results are ...

Finally, we conclude that ...

\section{Limitations}
\section{Conclusion}




\section{BRAIN STORM:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Test robustness with a custom mesh + noise (similar to what they did) and mesh+crossed triangles (shortcuts should break the results?)
  \item Test different step sizes (t's) verify that 1 seems to be the best
  \item Compare results numerically with 'perfect' algorithm from https://hhoppe.com/geodesics.pdf
  \item Find how to test with different data types (point clouds, triang meshes, poly meshes) and compare results (if possible in software without too much rewriting?)
  \item Try results on bad vs good triangulated meshes (to check if Delaunay works fine)
  \item Think about new possible applications? Videogames/3d animation?? 
  \item Check 2020 method to compute geodesics only by flipping triangles. One advantage seems to be that it works to find not only global shortest paths, but also local ones (if two points are next to each other, it can find the shortest path in the opposite direction by turning around)  https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3414685.3417839
  \item Test speed against fast marching method for scalar heat method
  \item Check behaviour at Cut locus and comment it
  \item Look for applications the Karcher mean
